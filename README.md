# Species Invasion in a Network Population Model

## Abstract

We formulate a network model of biotic invasion incorporating logistic
growth and dispersal along a network, and present analyses of
the model. We introduce small world networks and use them to
investigate the role of network properties and long-distance dispersal
on spread dynamics. Lastly we present comparisons between
the stochastic and deterministic models to illustrate the effects of
stochasticity on invasive species spread dynamics.
